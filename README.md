This package contains a URDF description for JAXON, a humanoid robot developed by the JSK laboratory at the University of Tokyo, and showcased at the DARPA Robotics Challenge Finals in June 2015.

## History

The original JAXON description was published under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license in the [rtmros\_choreonoid](https://github.com/start-jsk/rtmros_choreonoid) repository. It was provided in VRML, the robot description format used by [OpenHRP3](https://fkanehiro.github.io/openhrp3-doc/en/). That description was converted to COLLADA using ``openhrp-export-collada`` and published under the same license in the [openrave\_models](https://github.com/stephane-caron/openrave_models/tree/master/JAXON) repository. Finally, the resulting COLLADA description was converted to URDF using [``collada_urdf``](https://wiki.ros.org/collada_urdf).
